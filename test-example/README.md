# Test Example

This folder contains an example test project which can be run against a plain Karaf or an OpenNMS Horizon docker-compose project.

To run the test examples manually see [Running Examples](../../main/docs/RunningExamples.md)

The project can be run manually or can be automated as part of a continuous build which tests the opennms-paxexam framework.
